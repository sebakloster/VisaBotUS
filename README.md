# USVisaBot
This bot checks if there is any available appointment before an specified date. Then it sends you a telegram message if an appointment was found. 

- I recommend to set the interval time in 5 minutes, otherwise you could get banned for 5 hours. 

- In order to config the telegram bot you should check the following website:
